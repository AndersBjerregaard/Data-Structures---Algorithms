# Data-Structures---Algorithms
Created and Maintained by AndersBjerregaard

This is a repository of my sample C# projects under the topic of "Data Structures & Algorithms", during my 4th semester of studying Computer Science.

The projects aim to shed a light on the practical implementations of complex data structures and their coherrent algorithms in C#.
The implementations are aimed to be as generic as the given data structure allows. For the purpose of including said implementations in a library.
